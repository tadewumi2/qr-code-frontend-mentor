## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Relative/Absolute position
- Transform
  Since it's a static layout, I didn't bother coding for any specific screen type.

### What I learned

Eventhough I have a rough idea about relative/absolute position, it is great to actually use it in a project.

```css
body {
  position: relative;
}

#container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will like to practice the 'position' and 'transform' property more.

### Useful resources

Initially, I could not grasp the conceptof having a QR code 'image' that is not exactly 'doing anything'. Youtube, stack overflow and google were quite helpful.
